/**
 * The HTML Area element (\<area>) defines a hot-spot region on an image, 
 * and optionally associates it with a hypertext link. 
 * 
 * This element is used only within a \<map> element.
 *
 * @example {
 *      <map name="primary">
 *          <area shape="circle" coords="200,250,25" href="another.htm" />
 *          <area shape="default" nohref />
 *      </map>
 * }
 *
 * @note {
 *  Under the HTML 3.2, 4.0, and 5 specifications, the closing tag \</area> is
 *  forbidden.
 * }
 *
 * @note {
 *  The XHTML 1.0 specification requires a trailing slash: \<area />.
 * }
 *
 * @note {
 *  The id, class, and style attributes have the same meaning as the core
 *  attributes defined in the HTML 4 specification, but only Netscape and
 *  Microsoft define them.
 * }
 *
 * @note {
 *  Netscape 1â€“level browsers do not understand the target attribute as it
 *  relates to frames.
 * }
 *
 * @note {
 *  HTML 3.2 defines only alt, coords, href, nohref, and shape.
 * }
