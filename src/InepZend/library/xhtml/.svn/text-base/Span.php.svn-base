/**
 * Used to group in-line HTML.
 *
 * \<span> applies no meaning and is commonly used solely to apply CSS.
 *
 * This HTML element is a generic inline container for phrasing content, which
 * does not inherently represent anything.
 *
 * It can be used to group elements for styling purposes
 * (using the class or id attributes), or because they share attribute values,
 * such as lang.
 *
 * It should be used only when no other semantic element is appropriate.
 * \<span> is very much lika a \<div> element, but \<div> is a block-level
 * element whereas a \<span> is an inline element.
 *
 * @example {
 *   <p><span>Some text</span></p>
 * }
 *
