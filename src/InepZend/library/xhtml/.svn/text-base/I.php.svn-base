/**
 * The HTML Offset Text (or Italics) Element (\<i>) represents a range of text
 * that is set off from the normal text for some reason, for example, technical 
 * terms, foreign language phrases, or fictional character thoughts. 
 * 
 * It is typically displayed in italic type.
 *
 * @example {
 *  <p>
 *      Come by this way <i>amigo</i>, spoke the kid after open the door.
 *  </p>
 * }
 *
 * @note {
 * Use this element only when there is not a more appropriate semantic element. For example:
 * <ul>
 *      <li> Use \<em> to indicate stress emphasis. </li>
 *      <li> Use \<strong> to indicate importance. </li>
 *      <li> Use \<mark> to indicate relevance. </li>
 *      <li> Use \<cite> to mark the name of a work, such as a book, play or song. </li>
 *      <li> Use \<dfn> to mark the defining instance of a term. </li>
 * </ul>
 * }
 *
 * @note {
 *  It is a good idea to use the class attribute to identify why the element
 *  is being used, so that if the presentation needs to change at a later date,
 *  it can be done selectively with style sheets.
 * }
